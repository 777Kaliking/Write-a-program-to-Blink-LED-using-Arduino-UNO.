#AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT:
Write a program to Blink LED using Arduino UNO. 

 THEORY: 
 

In this lesson, we will program the Arduino's GPIO output high level (+5V) and low level (0V), and then make the LED which is connected to the Arduino’s GPIO flicker with a certain frequency.

The LED is the abbreviation of light emitting diode. It is usually made of gallium arsenide, gallium phosphide semiconductor materials. The LED has two electrodes: a positive electrode and a negative one. 

 The main function of the resistor is to limit currents. In the circuit, the character ‘R’ represents resistor, and the unit of resistor is ohm(Ω).

PROCEDURE:

 

· Connect one end of the resistor to the digital pin 8

· Connect the long leg of the LED (the positive leg, called the anode) to the other end of the resistor.

· Connect the short leg of the LED (the negative leg, called the cathode) to the GND.

 

 

CONCLUSION:

     After upload done, we have concluded that the on-board LED blink every second.
